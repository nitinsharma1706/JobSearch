## Introduction

The project aims to scrape job data from LinkedIn using the Python library BeautifulSoup and collate information in the given format. The scraped data will be transformed into three tables, namely jobs, company, and details, using Power Query. A search bar will be created using the Flask web framework where users can search for skills, and information such as the most common experience level, industry, and company class where the skill is required, and the number of jobs available will be displayed. Additionally, the FuzzyBuzzy library will be used to correct user input errors in the search bar.

## Methodology

The following methodology was used to accomplish the project objectives:

1. **Data Scraping:** The job data was scraped from LinkedIn using the Python library BeautifulSoup. The data was scraped based on specific search criteria, such as job titles, job locations, and company names.

2. **Data Transformation:** The scraped data was transformed into three tables, namely jobs, company, and details with the help of Power Query and Excel. The jobs table contained attributes such as job_id, company_id, location, designation, and details_id. The company table contained attributes such as company_id, name, industry, employees_count, and linkedin_followers. The details table contained attributes such as details_id, involvement, level, total_applicants, and skills.

3. **Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:** The data cleaning process encompassed eliminating irrelevant data, addressing missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, cleaning textual data, handling outliers, converting data types, checking for inconsistencies, normalizing categorical data, and validating data integrity.

4. **Dashboard Creation:** A dashboard was created using Power BI to provide an interactive visualization of the data. The dashboard included various charts and graphs to display the data in an easy-to-understand format. The charts included a skill distribution chart, a company class distribution chart, and a job location chart.

5. **Feature Extraction:** The NLTK library was used to gather the required skills from the job descriptions in the details table with the help of Natural Language Processing.

6. **Company Classification:** The companies were classified into four classes, namely Class1, Class2, Class3, and Class4, based on their employee count and LinkedIn followers using K-Means clustering algorithm. A new column was added to the company table to represent the company class. Additionally we also evaluated it by Elbow Method and the optimum number of clusters are 4.

7. **User Interface:** A search bar was created using the Flask web framework where users could search for skills. The FuzzyBuzzy library was used to correct user input errors in the search bar. Upon entering the skill, the most common experience level, industry, and company class where the skill is required, and the number of jobs available for the skill were displayed.

## Results

### 1. Key Insights from Dashboard

- Maximum No of Jobs are in Bengaluru.

- Top Hiring Industries are Information and Technology, Financial, and Education.
 
- Top 5 States which have the most jobs are Delhi, Maharashtra, Haryana, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.

- Most of the Jobs are Full Time.

- Large Company which are having employees count of 1000+ having 52% volume of total Jobs

- When we are selecting Delhi we get to know that we have most of the jobs in Education Sector and then Information and Technology

- We also get to know that Education sector has 37.29% Internships.

- If we select Maharastra then we get to know that the  top industries are IT and Finance.

## Limitation
   
- One limitation of this project is the dependency on the structure and layout of the LinkedIn website. If LinkedIn changes its webpage structure or adds additional security measures, it may affect the data scraping process and require adjustments to the scraping code.
- Another limitation of the project is that the accuracy and effectiveness of NLP in improving user input may vary depending on the complexity of the queries and the available training data. Ongoing research and improvements in NLP techniques can help enhance the accuracy and performance of user input correction.

## Challenges: 
   
- One of the main challenges faced in this project is implementing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve user input. NLP is a complex field, and incorporating it to enhance user input requires in-depth research and understanding. Overcoming the challenge of integrating NLP effectively to correct user input errors can be time-consuming and technically demanding.

- Another challenge which faced in this project was the initial difficulty in creating a webpage for user input after learning Flask from various sources. While Flask provided the necessary tools for web development, there was a learning curve involved in understanding its concepts and applying them effectively.
